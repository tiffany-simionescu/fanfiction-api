# fanfiction-api

This is a RESTful API built with NodeJS, Express and protected with Auth0. It has two front-end clients built with NodeJS that use the API. The user facing app has access to the fanfiction, authors and category endpoints, while the admin app also has access to the pending endpoint which returns fanfictions that are not ready to be publically accessible.
